# Astra

Astra is just a personal project for me to practice Java and Spring Boot. It currently consists of 2 parts: Spring Boot backend and React frontend.

## Backend

### Tech Stack (BE Spring)

1. Java 17
2. Spring Boot
3. Firebase Admin
4. MyBatis

### Tech Stack (FE Web)

1. NextJS
2. Mantine
3. Firebase Client

### Tech Stack (FE Mobile)

Currently mobile development is in progress but my priority will be placed on the web app as I would need to use it soon.

## Features

### v0.1.0

1. Login by email and password / Google
2. Update user details
3. Create a new fitness goal
