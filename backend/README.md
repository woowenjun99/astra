# Astra

Project Astra is a personal assistant application. It is intended to be a super application that 
simplifies different aspects of one's life. We hope that through this project, we can pick up meaningful
knowledge.

## Pre-requisites

1. Maven Installed
2. Java 17 Installed

## Tech Stack

The Tech stack will be very similar to what I use in Bytedance. The reason for this is that I want to
build things up from scratch and learn how the things work under the hood.

1. Spring Web 
2. MyBatis (To communicate with the Database)
3. Firebase Authentication (To authenticate the user)
